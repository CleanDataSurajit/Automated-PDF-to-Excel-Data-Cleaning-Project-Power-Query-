  Automated PDF to Excel Data Cleaning Project (Power Query)

  Project Overview

This project demonstrates how I extracted, cleaned, transformed, and consolidated multiple PDF reports into a single structured Excel file using Microsoft Excel Power Query.

The source data was provided in five separate PDF files from an ITcompany.Each file contained structured report data,but there were multiple formatting issues that made the data unsuitable for direct analysis.My goal was to convert these unstructured PDF files into a clean,professional,and analysis-ready Excel dataset through an automated workflow.

  Problems in the Raw PDF Files

Unclear and inconsistent column headers

Multiple columns merged together

Blank rows within the dataset

Incorrect or inconsistent date formats

Improper data types

Repetitive manual processing required
---
  Steps Performed in Power Query
1. Imported all PDF files using Get Data → From Folder


2. Combined multiple files into one master query


3. Renamed column headers with standardized names


4. Split merged columns into separate structured fields


5. Removed blank rows and cleaned null values


6. Fixed and standardized date column formats


7. Assigned correct data types to each column


8. Loaded the cleaned data into Excel

  Automation Feature
The entire transformation process is fully automated.

If new PDF files (with the same structure) are added to the folder:

Simply click Refresh

All new data is automatically extracted

Cleaned and appended to the master Excel sheet


This reduces manual effort, saves time, and minimizes human error.
